The hero of the game ![Player image](https://github.com/GaProgMan/javascriptGame/blob/master/images/hero-small.png "Hero") descides to go on a walk through the forest, when he is suddenly cornered by monster ![enemy image](https://github.com/GaProgMan/javascriptGame/blob/master/images/monster.png "Enemy"). The monster wants to eat the hero... because plot.

Monsters are known to give chase at full speed for a short time before they become fatigued and must slow down. This is the key to the hero's survival: learn the pattern of the monster's fatigue level, and the hero will survive.

The hero has lived a life of luxury and has never taken fencing lessons, therefore he is unable to fight against the monster. His fear level gives him a greater level of stamina than most of the monsters, however he will soon become fatigued if he constantly runs away from the monsters. Remember, hero, you must take a rest every so often.
